Kusina Pinoy is a website that shares the delicious and popular food of the Philippines.
Our goal is to show people how tasty Filipino dishes are. Some of the well-known meals
we feature are Chicken Adobo, Kare-Kare, and Sinigang. These dishes are full of flavor
and are part of our culture.

We created this website using HTML and CSS. HTML helped us build the structure of the
site, and CSS made it look nice and clean. We used soft colors and a red theme to match
the warm and friendly feeling of Filipino food. The layout is also responsive, so it works
well on different screen sizes like phones and computers.

Our goal is to help people learn more about Filipino food and enjoy the beauty of our
culture. We hope that when you visit our website, you feel the love and pride we have for
every dish we share. Thank you for exploring Kusina Pinoy!
